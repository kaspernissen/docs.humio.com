Notifier templates are used to create the message sent by notifiers. 
They currently apply to [e-mail](/features/alerts/notifiers/email/) and [WebHook](/features/alerts/notifiers/webhook/) notifiers.
The template engine is a simple "search/replace" model, where the `{…}` marked placeholders are replaced with contextual aware variables. 

See the list for an explanation of the placeholders
