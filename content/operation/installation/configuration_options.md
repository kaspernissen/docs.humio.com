This describes the configuration parameters for Humio, and their default values.
Please see [the installation instructions](/operation/installation/) on where to place the configuration file.

```
# JVM arguments. Make sure to increase stac size to at least 2M (-Xss2M) and allow XX:MaxDirectMemorySize to be at least half of available RAM.
# You may also need to add -Xmx4 to allow 4G of heap space, but on systems with plenty of memory and JDK8 or newer, the JRE defaults are okay.
# You can tune "Akka" configurations using -Dconfig.file=/home/humio/akka.conf and -Dakka.log-config-on-start=on. notably akka.http.server, through the file referred by config.file. (Remember to mount using -v on docker)
HUMIO_JVM_ARGS=-Xss2M -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=4G

# License key. Required if you are not running Humio as a trial version. Set one of these.
#LICENSE_KEYSTRING=SomeLongStringYouHaveFromHumioSales
# - or -
#LICENSE_FILE=PAthToFileHoldingKeyString


# Make Humio write a backup of the data files. The BACKUP_KEY is user fdor encryption.
#BACKUP_NAME=
#BACKUP_KEY=

# ID to choose for this server when starting up the first time.
# Leave commented out to autoselect the next available ID.
# If set, the server refuses to run unless the ID matches the state in data.
# If set, must be a (small) positive integer.
#BOOTSTRAP_HOST_ID=1

# The URL that other hosts can use to reach this server. Required.
# Examples: https://humio01.example.com  or  http://humio01:8080
# Security: We recommend using a TLS endpoint.
# If all servers in the Humio cluster share a closed LAN, using those endpoints may be okay.
#EXTERNAL_URL=https://humio01.example.com

# Kafka bootstrap servers list. Used as `bootstrap.servers` towards kafka.
# should be set to a comma separated host:port pairs string.
# Example: `my-kafka01:9092` or `kafkahost01:9092,kafkahost02:9092`
#KAFKA_SERVERS=kafkahost01:9092,kafkahost02:9092

# Zookeeper servers.
# Defaults to "localhost:2181", which is okay for a single server system, but
# should be set to a comma separated host:port pairs string.
# Example: zoohost01:2181,zoohost02:2181,zoohost03:2181
# Note, there is NO security on the zookeeper connections. Keep inside trusted LAN.
#ZOOKEEPER_URL=localhost:2181

# Possible to use this if Humio is behind a proxy.
# Add a subpath to the url where Humio is hosted
# For examplea proxy at `http://myorg.com/` could expose Humio at `http://myorg.com/internal/humio/`. Then PROXY_PREFIX_URL=/internal/humio
#PROXY_PREFIX_URL=/internal/humio

# Humio limits the allowed memory one query can use. It is possible to disable this at on-premises installations
ALLOW_UNLIMITED_STATE_SIZE=false

# Settings controlling auto-sharding.
MAX_DISTINCT_TAG_VALUES=5000
TAG_HASHING_BUCKETS=16

# Setting controlling auto-tagging of datasources with too much data for one stream. Defaults to 6MB/s.
AUTOSHARDING_TRIGGER_SPEED=6291456

# Number of blocks of 1MB stored in each segment. You can raise this to e.g 2000 or perhaps 4000 to get fewer, larger segments files. Or lower it to get retention to kick in ealier.
# Default is 1000. Minimum is 100.
BLOCKS_PER_SEGMENT=1000

# Compression level for event data files.
# 0 => Use the `FAST` implemetation.
# 1 - 17 => Use the `High` implemetation. Recommended values are in the range 4 .. 9
# Default is 6.
COMPRESSION_LEVEL=6

# If a query is not used (polled) - how long should Humio wait until it does not keep the query running
IDLE_POLL_TIME_BEFORE_LIVE_QUERY_IS_CANCELLED_MINUTES=60

# Limit size of internal state of each query internally in the cluster in bytes. Defaults to MaxHeapSize/128
# When a query results in larger results, the query is aborted, and gets a warning of "State too large. Lower your limits to get results."
# If you have few but large queries, you may increase this to e.g. MaxHeapSize/32 or even MaxHeapSize/16, but with a high risk of OOM.
#MAX_INTERNAL_STATESIZE=...

# By default, root is able to query data in all dataspaces without being a member of them, and is able to set retention setting and delete data from all dataspaces.
# Setting ENFORCE_AUDITABLE=true restricts root from this: He is no longer member of a dataspace unless explicitly added,
#  and can only set retention or delete data by having the explicit permission granted, like any other user with that permission.
# See `audit-logs`for more informartion on how the audit logging works.
# Default: false
#ENFORCE_AUDITABLE=false

# How long should the `sensitive` part of the audit log be kept. Default to 200 years.
# Set as number of days. Example: 10 years = 3653 days.
#AUDITLOG_SENSITIVE_RETENTION_DAYS=3653
