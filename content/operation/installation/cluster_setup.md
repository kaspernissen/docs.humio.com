## Overview

This section describes how to install Humio configured as a distributed system across multiple machines.

## Prerequisites

Running a distributed Humio setup requires a Kafka cluster (version 1.0).
You can setup such a cluster using our Docker image. Or you can install Kafka using some other method.

***Installation and configuration scripts***

We have created a [github repository](https://github.com/humio/provision-humio-cluster) with scripts to help install and configure Humio.
We suggest you read through the documentation below and have a look at repository. Check out the scripts and modify them for your environment.

### Running the Kafka Docker image from humio/humio-kafka

{{% notice note %}}
The suggested default is to run 3 instances of the Docker image each containing a Kafka and Zookeeper instance.
The zookeeper and kafka instances must run on ports, that the Humio instances can connect to.
The suggested setup below maps the user "Humio" on the host machine to the user "Humio" inside the Docker containers
and runs the Kafka, zookeeper and Humio processes as that user. This allows the processes to write to the mounted data directories.
Tailor according to your needs and make sure the "/data/" directories are on a mount point with sufficient storage. (e.g. probably not "/")

The data is split on 4 mountpoints, in the example configurations below on these prefixes:

1. /data/logs holds logfiles from the various processes.
2. /data/zookeeper-data holds zookeeper data. (Not much)
3. /data/kafka-data holds Kafka data.
4. /data/humio-data holds Humio data.
{{% /notice %}}

The following shows how to use the `humio/humio-kafka` image to set up
Zookeeper and Kafka in a 3 machine cluster.

For each machine do:

1. Ensure the `humio` user exists

        adduser --disabled-password --disabled-login humio

1. Add the `humio` user to docker group to run docker without sudo. (humio user should not have sudo access)

        usermod -aG docker humio


1. Create a data directory for zookeeper

        mkdir -p /data/logs
        chown -R humio:humio /data/logs
        mkdir -p /data/zookeeper-data
        chown -R humio:humio /data/zookeeper-data

1. Create a configuration file for Zookeeper. Replace the `HOST_1-3`
variables with the DNS name or IP addresses of your hosts; here is the
configuration file for `HOST`.

        cat << EOF > /home/humio/zookeeper.properties
        dataDir=/data/zookeeper-data
        clientPort=2181
        clientPortAddress=${HOST}
        tickTime=2000
        initLimit=5
        syncLimit=2
        server.1=${HOST_1}:2888:3888
        server.2=${HOST_2}:2888:3888
        server.3=${HOST_3}:2888:3888
        EOF

1. Set the `myid` file the ID of the given server as specified in the
configuration file above (`1`, `2` or `3`)

        echo 1 > /data/zookeeper-data/myid
        chown humio:humio /data/zookeeper-data/myid


1. Create a data directory for Kafka

        mkdir -p /data/kafka-data
        chown -R humio:humio /data/kafka-data

1. Create a configuration file for Kafka. Each server needs to have a
unique name and an `broker.id`  (`1`, `2` or `3`). Make sure the listener is something
the humio instances can reach. If in doubt, please refer to the Kafka
documentation. Here is the configuration file for `HOST`, remember
to set `broker.id` and `listeners` accordingly

        cat << EOF > /home/humio/kafka.properties
        broker.id=1
        log.dirs=/data/kafka-data
        zookeeper.connect=${HOST_1}:2181,${HOST_2}:2181,${HOST_3}:2181
        listeners=PLAINTEXT://${HOST}:9092
        replica.fetch.max.bytes=104857600
        message.max.bytes=104857600
        compression.type=producer
        num.partitions=1
        log.retention.hours=48
        log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000
        unclean.leader.election.enable=false
        broker.id.generation.enable=false
        auto.create.topics.enable=false
        EOF


1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and pull the latest `humio/humio-kafka` Docker image

        docker pull humio/humio-kafka

1. Start the Docker images on each host, mounting the configuration files and data locations created in previous steps

        docker run -d  --restart always --net=host \
        -v /home/humio/zookeeper.properties:/etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties \
        -v /home/humio/kafka.properties:/etc/kafka/kafka.properties \
        -v /data/logs:/data/logs \
        -v /data/zookeeper-data:/data/zookeeper-data  \
        -v /data/kafka-data:/data/kafka-data  \
        --name humio-kafka "humio/humio-kafka"


Verify that Zookeeper and Kafka is happy

1. Inspecting the log files:

        /data/logs/zookeeper_std_out.log
        /data/logs/kafka_std_out.log

2. Using "nc" to get the status of each zookeeper instance.
   The following must respond with either "Leader" or "Follower" for all instances:

        echo stat | nc 192.168.1.1 2181 | grep '^Mode: '


3. Optionally, using your favourite Kafka tools to validate the state of your Kafka cluster.
   You could list the topics using this, expecting to get an empty list since this is a fresh install of Kafka

        kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --list


## Running the Humio Docker container

Humio is distributed as Docker images; use the `humio/humio-core` edition for distributed deployments.

### Steps

1. Create an empty file on the host machine to store the Humio configuration. For example, `humio.conf`.
<br />
You can use this file to pass on JVM arguments to the Humio Java process.

1. Enter and then edit the following settings into the configuration file:

        # The stacksize should be at least 2M.
        # We suggest setting MaxDirectMemory to 50% of physical memory. At least 2G required.
        HUMIO_JVM_ARGS=-Xss2M -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=32G

        # Make Humio write a backup of the data files:
        # Backup files are written to mount point "/backup".
        #BACKUP_NAME=my-backup-name
        #BACKUP_KEY=my-secret-key-used-for-encryption

        # ID to choose for this server when starting up the first time.
        # Leave commented out to autoselect the next available ID.
        # If set, the server refuses to run unless the ID matches the state in data.
        # If set, must be a (small) positive integer.
        #BOOTSTRAP_HOST_ID=1

        # The URL that other hosts can use to reach this server. Required.
        # Examples: https://humio01.example.com  or  http://humio01:8080
        # Security: We recommend using a TLS endpoint.
        # If all servers in the Humio cluster share a closed LAN, using those endpoints may be okay.
        EXTERNAL_URL=https://humio01.example.com

        # Kafka bootstrap servers list. Used as `bootstrap.servers` towards kafka.
        # should be set to a comma separated host:port pairs string.
        # Example: `my-kafka01:9092` or `kafkahost01:9092,kafkahost02:9092`
        KAFKA_SERVERS=kafkahost01:9092,kafkahost02:9092

        # Zookeeper servers.
        # Defaults to "localhost:2181", which is okay for a single server system, but
        # should be set to a comma separated host:port pairs string.
        # Example: zoohost01:2181,zoohost02:2181,zoohost03:2181
        # Note, there is NO security on the zookeeper connections. Keep inside trusted LAN.
        #ZOOKEEPER_URL=localhost:2181

        # Select the TCP port to listen for http.
        #HUMIO_PORT=8080

        # Select the IP to bind the udp/tcp/http listening sockets to.
        # Each listener entity has a listen-configuration. This ENV is used when that is not set.
        #HUMIO_SOCKET_BIND=0.0.0.0

        # Select the IP to bind the http listening socket to. (Defaults to HUMIO_SOCKET_BIND)
        #HUMIO_HTTP_BIND=0.0.0.0


1. Create an empty directory on the host machine to store data for Humio:

        mkdir /data/humio-data

1. Pull the latest Humio image:

        docker pull humio/humio-core

{{% notice warning %}}
If you get a 'permission denied' error, then contact Humio to gain access to the `humio/humio-core` private repository.
{{% /notice %}}

1. Run the Humio Docker image as a container:

        docker run -d  --restart always --net=host \
        -v /data/logs:/data/logs \
        -v /data/humio-data:/data/humio-data \
        -v /backup:/backup  \
        --env-file $PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE --name humio-core humio/humio-core

    Replace `/data/humio-data` before the `:` with the path to the humio-data directory you created on the host machine, and `$PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE` with the path of the configuration file you created.

1. Verify that Humio is able to start using the configuration provided by looking at the log file.
   In particular, it should *not* keep on logging problems connecting to Kafka.

        grep 'Humio server is now running!'  /data/logs/humio_std_out.log
        grep -i 'kafka'  /data/logs/humio_std_out.log


1. Humio is now running. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the Humio web interface.

{{% notice info %}}
In the above example, we started the Humio container with full access to the network of the host machine. In a production environment, you should restrict this access by using a firewall, or adjusting the Docker network configuration.

***Starting Humio as a service***

There are different ways of starting the docker container ["as a service"](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/host_integration/).
In the above example, we used Dockers [restart policies](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#restart-policies-restart). It can be started using a process manager. [A systemd example is provided here](/operation/installation/#systemd-service-example)
